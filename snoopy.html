    <p> According to Wikipedia, Snoopy is a character in a comic strip known as "Peanuts" by Charles M. Schulz. The character is described as a pet beagle belonging to a "Charlie Brown" with a personality of a loyal and imaginative type. This innocent, good-natured beagle is prone to having a wild imagination of fantasy lives but sometimes can be selfish or a bit lazy. Despite the characters odd behaviors, the beagle is described as showing lots of loyalty for his owner, Charlie Brown.
