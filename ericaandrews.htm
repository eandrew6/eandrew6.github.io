This program was completed in Java.<br>● Project Triangle: This program was created to allow the user to input three integers in order to determine whether they form a triangle. After the user has entered three integers, this program calculates and displays whether the three integers entered form or do not form a triangle. This program also calculates and displays whether the three integers entered to form a right triangle. This program was completed in Java.
                    <br>● Project Fat: This program was created to allow the user to input the number of calories and the number of fat grams in a food item in order to calculate the percentage of calories that come from the fat of the food item. After the user has entered the number of calories and the number of fat grams in a food item, the program calculates and displays whether the food item’s fat grams produce calories that are low in fat or not low in fat. If the food item’s fat grams produce calories that are not low in fat, this program will display a message of the calories entered and the percentage of calories that come from fat. This program will also display an error message of whether the calories from fat are greater than the total. This program was completed in Java.
                    <br>● Project Discount: This program was created to allow the user to calculate a discount based on a number entered for package quantity.

                    <br>● Project Seventh: This program is a user interactive display of a header that allows the user to enter a new header for a web page. Once the new header has been entered, the web page displays two prompts to the user. This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
                    <br>● Project Average: This program allows the user to calculate an average based on user input of a value or values. After user input, this program produces an output of a display of this average. This program was completed in Java.
                    <br>● Project JustaBlog: This project was created to build a website blog about a variety of topics. This website was completed using HTML and CSS.
                    <br>● Project First: This program allows the user to input different types of prompted headers of a web page. After the user has been prompt to input a new header, the new header is displayed. This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

                    <br>● Project Coins: This program calculates a puzzle based on multiplying coins. The user begins with twenty coins and gains ten coins every day after the initial coins for a year. The user also has three coins every week stolen within that year. This program calculates how many coins the user will have left. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Puzzle: This program calculates a puzzle that combines strings and a puzzle that calculates totals. The first puzzle combines lists and displays the lists as one using arithmetic and placeholders. The second puzzle calculates a total of three sets of twenty five and two sets of forty with arithmetic. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Ninjas: This program prints strings in a puzzle that calculates whether a value assigned to a total will display a print statement. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Earth: This program calculates the user’s “moon weight” for every year within sixteen years. Based on the user’s “earth weight”, the puzzle uses a loop to display the calculated moon weight. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Moon: This program creates a puzzle that calculates the user’s “moon weight” every year for sixteen years based on the user’s “initial weight” and “increased weight each year”. This program asks the user to input the current “Earth weight”, the amount of weight increased each year and the number of years. After the user has input these values, this program then calculates and displays the user’s moon weight for each year within the number of years entered. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Things: This program creates a puzzle that creates a “dancing” character. The character is given a set of assigned movements and a name. Once the characters name is called, the set of assigned movements is displayed. This program was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Message: This program creates a puzzle that allows the user to discover hidden messages. This puzzle allows the user to create a string that hides a message by combining two strings. The user discovers the “hidden” message by splitting the words within the string. Once the user has split the string, the program displays the puzzles hidden message within a print statement. This project was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Animals: This program creates a puzzle that creates a class to develop an animal. The class gives the animal a species, a number of legs and a color. This puzzle copies this class to create four animals. This project was completed in Python.
                    <br>● Project Guess: This program creates a puzzle that creates a guessing game that allows the user to guess a number. The user enters a number, between a range of one and one hundred, to guess the puzzles guess. The puzzle displays whether the user should guess a number that is higher or lower than the guess entered. When the user’s guess equals the puzzles guess, the puzzle displays a print statement that the user has guessed correctly. This project was completed in Python.
