After the user has entered the number of calories and the number of fat grams in a food item, the program calculates and displays whether the food item’s fat grams produce calories that are low in fat or not low in fat. If the food item’s fat grams produce calories that are not low in fat, this program will display a message of the calories entered and the percentage of calories that come from fat. This program will also display an error message of whether the calories from fat are greater than the total. This program was completed with Java.</td>
