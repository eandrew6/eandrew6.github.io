 <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">I</span> am a Computer Science major at the City College of San Francisco, and I have attended City College of San Francisco for at least two years. So far, I have taken many courses, and I am currently volunteering as a ‘Lab Aid’ for students with disabilities and volunteering for various companies and non-profits. I plan to apply for the certificates offered, present what I have learned to potential employers, and show what I have learned within my portfolio.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">I</span> am currently taking a course to learn about 'SEO Analytics for Web Developers' and to fulfill the requirements for certificates. I have taken ‘Computer Science’ and ‘Computer Networking and Information Technology’ courses before but this will be my first course on the subject of 'SEO Analytics'. I plan to learn from this course and apply what I learn to my personal projects. I also would like to apply what I learn from this course to professional assignments in the future.</p>
